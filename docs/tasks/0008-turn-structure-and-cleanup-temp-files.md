## Title

Turn structure enforcement: *place → (optional action) → pass* and automatic cleanup of obsolete temp files

## Goal

Implement strict turn sequencing in the core engine:

1. On your turn, you **must place exactly one tile** from your hand.
2. After placing, you **may perform exactly one additional action** (draw/place from other actions, expansions later).
3. Then you **must end your turn** (`core.passTurn`).

Additionally:
Whenever Codex generates or updates files during this task, ensure that **all temporary or intermediate files that are no longer used are deleted**.

This task codifies a central gameplay invariant: one tile placement per turn.

---

## Non-negotiables

* **English-only identifiers**.
* **Comments are mandatory**, especially around sequencing invariants.
* **Update `CHANGELOG.md`**.
* **Delete unused temp files generated by Codex** (explicit).
* Deterministic core behavior.
* Server authoritative.

---

## Sequencing model (must be explicit)

Add explicit turn phases in state:

* `phase: "awaitingPlacement" | "awaitingAction" | "awaitingPass"`
  (alternatively a numeric enum with comments)

Rules:

* A new turn always starts at `"awaitingPlacement"`.
* After a successful `core.placeTile`, change phase → `"awaitingAction"`.
* Allow exactly one **other** non-placement core action in `"awaitingAction"` (e.g., draw, later expansions).
* After that, enforce phase → `"awaitingPass"` and require `core.passTurn` to end turn.
* Reject invalid actions based on current phase with structured error codes:

  * `WRONG_TURN_PHASE`
  * `PLACEMENT_ALREADY_DONE`
  * `ACTION_NOT_ALLOWED_IN_PHASE`

Add comments explaining the invariant.

---

## Deliverables

### A) Core: Turn phase primitives

In `packages/core`, extend `GameState`:

* `phase` field as defined above
* enforce the turn lifecycle in `applyAction`

Modify `core.passTurn`:

* only allowed in `"awaitingPass"`
* resets phase to `"awaitingPlacement"` for next turn

Modify `core.placeTile`:

* only allowed in `"awaitingPlacement"`

Modify other core actions:

* only allowed in `"awaitingAction"` (reject in other phases)

Add comments explaining why these checks exist.

---

### B) Core: new errors for phase enforcement

Add errors:

* `WRONG_TURN_PHASE`
* `PLACEMENT_ALREADY_DONE`
* `ACTION_NOT_ALLOWED_IN_PHASE`

Ensure they are machine-readable and can be displayed in the client debug UI.

---

### C) State snapshot changes

Snapshot must expose:

* `turn`
* `activePlayerId`
* `phase`

Client must reflect current phase visually (debug panel is sufficient).

---

### D) Server: authoritative enforcement

The server must enforce the above phases strictly:

* reject invalid action with appropriate error code
* do not advance turn automatically unless `core.passTurn` succeeds

Add server tests for:

* placement allowed only in correct phase
* other actions only in `"awaitingAction"`
* pass only in `"awaitingPass"`

---

### E) Client: UI flow updates

In the client debug UI:

* Show current phase string
* Disable/enable buttons based on phase

  * “Place tile” only in `"awaitingPlacement"`
  * “Draw tile” (or other actions) only in `"awaitingAction"`
  * “Pass turn” only in `"awaitingPass"`

Add comments in UI code where sequencing logic is reflected.

---

### F) Cleanup temp files (your explicit addition)

**IMPORTANT:**
When generating code for this task, Codex must remove any temporary files or boilerplate that were created in previous generation steps and are **no longer used** (e.g., unused mocks, intermediate test files, placeholder configs, stale helpers).

To enforce this:

* In the prompt to Codex (task opening instructions), include:

  > *Identify and delete any temporary files that were created during code generation or scaffolding and are no longer referenced anywhere in the project.*

Codex must:

1. Analyze file references
2. Remove unused files
3. Update imports/tests accordingly
4. Document file removals in the task report

Example of temp files to clean up (if present):

* placeholder files like `temp_*.ts`
* generated mocks that are not used
* scratch files (`example_*`, `dummy_*`)
* old test sandboxes not referenced

Codex must not delete valid source code.

Add a note in the changelog about the cleanup.

---

### G) Tests

Add tests in `packages/core`:

* Phase enforcement:

  * cannot place after placement done
  * cannot draw/other actions before placement
  * only one extra action allowed
  * must pass turn only in correct phase

Ensure server tests mirror these.

---

### H) Changelog update (MANDATORY)

Append dated entry:

* Added turn sequencing phases (`awaitingPlacement`, `awaitingAction`, `awaitingPass`)
* Enforced placement → action → pass invariants
* Cleaned up unused temp files and intermediates

Document which files were removed.

Do not rewrite previous entries.

---

## Acceptance criteria

* `pnpm dev`, `pnpm -r build/test/lint` all pass
* Client UI reflects phase
* Turn sequencing enforced by server
* Temp files removed
* Comments document invariants
* No German identifiers

---

## Explicitly do NOT do

* Do not implement adjacency, scoring, or board rules beyond placement phase.
* Do not add expansions.
* Do not introduce new UI patterns beyond debug flow.

---

## Output requirements (Codex must report)

1. Summary
2. Files touched/removed
3. Manual verification steps
4. Exact commands
